      <p>I've been a dev and a leader for a good number of years touching various tech stacks and in various industries and I may have some relevant things to say about the state of things in Front-End Development. Here's some posts created with my hyper-simple homemade CMS.</p>

  <P>ðŸ‘‹ <br/>Welcome to my little toy "portfolio site". This will grow as time goes by and I think of cool ways to make stuff that doesn't require massive overhead. I knew it was time to work on some self-promo after several years of doing little aside from posting learnings in LinkedIn. I realized that this could also be an opportunity to express myself; to talk about my perspective as a primarily Front-End developer with over a decade of industry experience. I'm not really as crabby as I may seem in my small rant there, promise ;)</P>
  <p>I have worked as an individual contributor, team lead and a manager. It feels to me that I have worn many hats since jumping head-first into the wild, weird and <i>sometimes</i> wonderful world of web development.</p>
  <p>Performant, accessible and manageable front-ends is what I would like to create, if the situation can accommodate that.</p>
