            <summary>TL;DR</summary>
            <p>This is an opportunity to create something simple for a change, at least for the therapeutic aspect of it. Some nostalgia going on here too. Maybe I can put my money where my mouth is when it comes to my complaints about the framework madness in the Front-End development space.</p>
          </details>
          <p>What you're looking at is built on plain old ExpressJS with a PostgreSQL DB and <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/" target="_blank">Ye Olde Nunjucks templates</a> 👴🏻. After years of JavaScript framework fatigue, dealing with Angular and React/NextJS Front-Ends; never seeming to make truly efficient use my time, the user's time or the company's budget, I began to desire the experience of working on something that felt reasonable to me. <i>Call it therapy, if you will.</i></p>
          <p>The Node backend responds with HTML, can you say SSR? 😂 The HTML uses semantic tags and native browser functionality where appropriate. I just wrote CSS 😱. For most of the pages, there is no justification for the, now common, JavaScript <span class="stretch">bloat</span> of multiple megabytes just to render static content.</p>
          <p>On this little project, the idea is to fetch assets and run scripts only when required by the page. I will just throw new ideas on here when they arise and not be overly fastidious, so heads up 😉</p>
